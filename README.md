# SimpleSpeechRecognition
Speech recognition using machine learning to recognise simple commands and performing actions according to it.
list.py is the main function which recognizes the command and performs the specific task.
For dataset I have created my own dataset with commands that include:
        "Calculator",
        "Camera",
        "Firefox",
        "Sleep",
        "Stop",
        "Teams",
        "Yes"
